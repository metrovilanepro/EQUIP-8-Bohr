            <p id="p3">All About Our Project Output</p>
            <p id="p4">For our EQUIP project, we made science come alive by creating an outfit based on two magnificent examples of microscopic life: Protista and Archaea. Rather than simply explaining their features on paper, we turned their unique traits into wearable art.
            We centered on one specific species of protista known as Pyrocystis fusiformis. This small organism is renowned for its glowing light, almost like a light show in the ocean depths, brought to life. We reflected this in our pattern with glittery, vibrant textiles that shine above the competition, with inspiration from the enchanting luminosity of these organisms. The hues we incorporated, such as rich blues and vivid teals, are identical to the sea that they inhabit.
            For our archaea portion of our uniform, we were Halococcus salifodinae, a small organism that can exist in extremely salty environments.</p>
            <p id="p19">We embodied its strength and resilience in difficult environments through thick, textured fabrics and dark, vibrant colors. The reds, oranges, and purples we used in our design evoke the appearance of salt flats and other harsh locations.
            What is really unique about this project is that we built the whole outfit using recycled items. We took pieces of old clothes, plastic bottles, and other things that were going to be discarded and created something new and wonderful out of them. This proved that we can be innovative and creative even when we utilize what we already have, even if they were usually useless items, we turned them into decor for our outfit . Our mission was to provide the science about these incredible animals and, more importantly, to demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, we can create something beautiful out of just about anything.</p>
