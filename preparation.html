                <p id="p11">During our preparation, we first decided to construct the costumes for our female and male models. Costume design takes several steps, we decided to do detailed sketches first so that we would be able to visualize our thoughts and be aware of our possible mistakes before doing the construction. We focused on the dress portion of the female outfit, and thought carefully about the fabric, the patterns, the overall shape, all of those details matter to communicate our vision. After that we moved into thinking about the male costume, and working on designing the headdress, because one of the goals for the costume was to show some character and offer contrast in different ways. During the design process we also tried to note smaller details that could be added to those costumes, so that when our models moved around and/or posed in different ways, you could see something new retaining the thoughtful and creative visual content.</p>
                <p id="p11">After finalizing the construction of the costumes, we were focused on refining the website and presentation for clarity, visual appeal, and a cleaner look. We also assisted our representatives with approaches for how to pose, where to stand, expand their voice, and describe their designs. By refining the visual content and the presentation details, we left little room for error in our project and plan to ensure from the costumes to the presentation was a thoughtful emotional experience on any angle.</p>
